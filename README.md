Hi there! This is my an for the [everybody-codes](https://github.com/infi-nl/everybody-codes) assignment.

- The cli is in rust.
- The server in nodejs using express
- The frontend is in Typescript using React

#### CLI

**_Setup_**: You are going to need rust setup on your machine. https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

**_run_**: from the `search` dir run `cargo run -- -n <your search term>`

#### Server

**_Setup_**: you will need node (probably 14+) on your machine. From the `server` dir run `npm i`

**_run_**: from the `server` dir run `npm start`

#### Web

**_Setup_**: you will need node (probably 14+) on your machine. From the `web` dir run `npm i`
